# Acknowledgements
The first, and probably most significant acknowledgement has to go to the architects, developers, technical writers, and other staff members responsible for the **Raspberry Pi Pico** and **Pico W**, the **Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ SDK**, and the **Raspberry Pi Pico C/C++ Samples**.

This application implements a 'C' version of the American Morse encoding and decoding algorithms developed by *Les Kerr*.

The FAT file system and SD card libraries, with some small modifications (to configure for the MuKOB board and remove some printing), are from *ChaN* and *Carl Kugler* respectively.

As with every significant C project I've undertaken since the early '80s, my 'go-to' reference is **The C Programming Language** by *Brian Kernighan* and *Dennis Ritchie* (Prentice Hall, 1978 & 1988).
