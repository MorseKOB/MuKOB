[introduction]
= Introduction
This is the reference manual for the μKOB Key/Sounder/KOB/Paddle Interface MkV. It is not intended as a tutorial, and it is not a user manual for the μKOB device. It describes the external device connections to, and jumper settings of, the interface board.

= Preface
At a high level, the ((μKOB KS Interface)) (board) provides an interface between the ((μKOB)) main board and a ((KOB)) or a separate ((Key & Sounder)). It is also capable of being used as a KOB/Key&Sounder interface for the ((MKOB)) application running on a ((Raspberry Pi)) through the ((GPIO)) (((GPIO, Raspberry Pi))) connector,footnote:gpiorpi[In this document the term _the GPIO_ will be used to refer to the Raspberry Pi GPIO connector/connection.] or for the ((MKOB)) or ((MorseKOB)) application running on any system that supports a FTDIfootnote:ftdi[Future Technology Devices International (*FTDI*) is the manufacturer of the USB-Serial device used. The FTDI _Virtual Serial Port_ driver is part of the Linux and MacOS kernel, and auto-installs on Windows.] USB serial port.

Depending on the intended application - ((μKOB)), ((Raspberry Pi)), or ((USB Serial)) - certain components may or may not, be populated. The possible options are:footnote:ifconn[Since this interface board connects to μKOB and Raspberry Pi using a _((piggyback))_ connector on the bottom of the board, it isn't possible to assemble a board that can be used on both a μKOB and a Raspberry Pi.]

1. μKOB Only
2. μKOB + USB Serial
3. Raspberry Pi GPIO Only
4. Raspberry Pi + USB Serial
5. USB Serial Only

Following are sections that identify all of the connectors and option jumpers, setting the option jumpers for applications 1, 3, and 5 (2 and 4 can be deduced), connecting a KOB, a Key & Sounder, or a Paddle, including power options and current limit resistor.

This interface can be used with a KOB (_KOB_ = _Key On Board_, a Sounder and Key connected in series, typically as a single unit on a base) (((KOB, Key On Board))) or a separate key and sounder (((Key & Sounder, separate))). Within this document, a KOB or a key and sounder connected in series, will sometimes be referred to as _The Loop Circuit_, _The Loop_, or simply, _Loop_ (((Loop, Loop Circuit))).

== MKOB Suite Auto-Detect (USB Serial)

When using a single interface connected via the USB Serial and the MKOB Suite of applications (MKOB, MRT, Telegram, and the utilities), the configuration (preferences) can be set to auto-detect the interface. Using Configure (or the Preferences in MKOB) set the Serial Port value to *SDIF* (Silky Design Interface)(((SDIF, Silky Design Interface))). The value must by typed in manually. With the serial port set to *SDIF*, the application will search for the interface and once found it will automatically be used.

If more than one Silky Design interface is connected, the first interface found will be used.

=== Option Jumpers
[%unbreakable]
--
The option jumpers described in this section may or may not be configurable (via pins and jumpers) depending on how the interface board was assembled. It is possible that the options are hard-jumpered a specific way and cannot be changed. Unless noted, the option jumpers are either ON (jumpered) or OFF (open). Option jumper OP1 is the one 2-position option (left-right).


Going clockwise around the board, the option jumpers are:

== Sounder / KOB Loop Connection
[%unbreakable]
--
A Sounder or a KOB Loop (key and sounder connected in series) are connected to the interface board using the screw-terminal block ST1. A user-supplied ((current limiting resistor))(((resistor, current limiting))) must be connected to screw-terminal block ST2. The resistor is positioned on the inside to reduce ((radio interference)) and to help guard against touching it, as it may become warm during operation.

Power for the sounder/loop is normally provided by a user-supplied power module connected via J2. Refer to the <<Externally Powered Loop>> section below if connecting to a powered telegraph loop.

Selecting the appropriate power module voltage and the current limiting resistor value depends on the sounder being used. The following table provides values that can be used as a starting point.

NOTE: The values in the table are meant to be used with this interface board and a Sounder or KOB for enjoying and practicing land-line telegraphy. They are not meant to indicate what was used in actual telegraph circuits _of the day_.

CAUTION: Some telegraphy enthusiasts use higher voltages and/or lower valued current limiting resistors to get a more _SNAPPY_ sound/response. Just remember that, in most cases, you are dealing with antique equipment that, if damaged, can be impossible to repair. If the sounder windings are over-powered long enough, or too many times, it can cause the (very thin) insulation coating the (extremely fine) wire to fail, causing an internal short. This results in the sounder becoming an interesting paper weight or conversation provoking door stop, rather than a functional telegraph instrument. It is suggested that you start with a lower voltage and/or higher resistor value. Then, if the sound produced isn't satisfactory, slightly increase the voltage *or* decrease the resistor value until a good, solid, *CLICK* is produced. Note that the *CLACK* is produced by the spring and other adjustments of the sounder, so voltage and resistance values don't really affect it.

=== Externally Powered Loop
The interface board is designed to make it easy to set up a personal telegraph station by providing a convenient way to provide power to the Sounder / KOB Loop. However, rather than powering the Sounder / KOB Loop from a power supply connected to J2, the interface board can be connected into a powered telegraph loop if the following conditions are met:

* The loop power must be DC
* The loop voltage must not exceed 80 volts (regardless of the amperage)
* The loop amperage must not exceed 1 amp (regardless of the voltage)
* The loop wattage must not exceed 3 watts (all sounders and other equipment in the loop energized)

If the existing telegraph loop has appropriate current limiting, the current limit resistor normally connected to ST2 can be replaced by a jumper wire. ST2 must have a resistor or a jumper wire in order to complete the loop circuit.

When connecting to a powered telegraph loop the LPWR-EPWR / OP1 jumper should be to the right (EPWR)(((External Power, EPWR))).

The interface board must be connected into the telegraph loop with the positive side of the loop circuit connected to the screw terminal nearer the J2 Power Jack (right side when viewing the face of the terminal block) and the negative side of the loop circuit connected to the screw terminal away from the J2 Power Jack (left when viewing the face of the terminal block). The interface board will introduce a 0.5 volt drop into the telegraph loop circuit.

== Key/Paddle Input

When using a separate key and sounder, or a paddle, the ((key)) or ((paddle))(((connecting, key or paddle))) is connected to the 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) phone jack ((J3)).

IMPORTANT: No power should be applied to this connection.

The connection is the same as many common HAM radios. It is illustrated below:
